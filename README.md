# NAME OF PROJECT - Verification Bot

## About the project

- [ ] Send reminders to participants about start time and end time for each day of challenge

## Why choose our project?

- When there are hundreds of participants in a challenge, the manual verification of the daily posts of each participants can be a tremendous work.
- So as a solution, our team has created an automated bot that can be invited to the server.
- It can help moderators reduce workload to a huge extent thus saving both **time** and **effort**.
- Not only that, it will also help participants give a reminder thus saving them from being kicked out of a challenge!
