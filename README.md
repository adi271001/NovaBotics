## Why choose our project?

When there are hundreds of participants in a challenge, the manual verification of the daily posts of each participants can be a tremendous work. So as a solution, our team has created an automated bot that can be invited to the server. It can help moderators reduce workload to a huge extent thus saving both **time** and **effort**. Not only that, it will also help participants give a reminder thus saving them from being kicked out of a challenge!
